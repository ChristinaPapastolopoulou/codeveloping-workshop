# Codeveloping workshop example

This is the repository for the codeveloping workshop example.

In this workshop, you will go through a couple of excercises that involve common ways of working togheter on a software project.

All of these exercises assume you have paired up with another person.

## The website

This repository contains an example website we'll be working on.
All the content of this website is in the html/js/css files here, and in the markdown files under /pages

Unfortunately, directly opening the index.html does not work.
So in order to run a small webserver on your machine, please open a terminal and navigate to where you put the workshop code, and run the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

You should not need to install anything for this to work.
