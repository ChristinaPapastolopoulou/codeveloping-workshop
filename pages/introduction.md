# Introduction

Looks like you have successfully started the server and are now looking at the introduction.

Take a moment to read this introduction and then go through the examples on the left.

## Things I assume you know

- How to work with git
- How to work with the command line

In the presentation before this I briefly explained how a team generally works with GIT.
From that I assume you know how to push, pull, merge and create branches using GIT.


## This website

This website displays markdown files (simple text files that look nice) and displays a list of those files on the left side of the screen.

In order to do this, it reads a special text file at `pages/listing.txt`.
Each line in this file corresponds to a markdown file under `pages/`.

In these exercises, the files under this `pages/` directory are all that you will need to edit.

If you really feel like it and are familiar with web development, you can edit the `index.js` or `index.html` later on.

The first exercise will be `resolving-merge-conflicts.md`.
Go there by clicking the navigation item on the left.
More exercises will appear as you do stuff.
