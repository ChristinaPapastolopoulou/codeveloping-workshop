# Introduction

Looks like you have successfully started the server and are now looking at the introduction.

Take a moment to read this introduction to the content of the repository you will be working with and then go through the examples on the left.


## This website

This website displays markdown files (simple text files that look nice) and displays a list of those files on the left side of the screen.

In order to do this, it reads a special text file called `listing.txt` under the pages/ directory.

Take a look there now.
In these exercises, the files under this directory are all that you will need to edit.

If you really feel like it, you can edit the `index.js` or `index.html` later on.

The first exercise will be `resolving-merge-conflicts.md`.
Go there by clicking the navigation item on the left.
More exercises will appear as you do stuff.
